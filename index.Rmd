KNIGHT COMPENDIUM IS OUTDATED AND BROKEN, SEE https://deynarde.github.io/kag-knight-guide/ FOR A COMPLETE KNIGHT GUIDE



~~Welcome to deynarde & Joan of Arc's (Eluded) Knight Compendium.~~

~~This is not a guide to playing knight, but rather a collection of all the tricks and techniques that knights can perform. Each move is accompanied by some explanation as well as an animated GIF.~~

~~Through this compendium we want to show that there is far more to knight combat than some may think; at a high level a knight has a myriad of different tactics with which to outwit his/her opponents – and it is this complexity which makes knight combat interesting and fun.
If you can master every technique here then you will become a fearsome opponent indeed!~~

~~We want this list to be as comprehensive as possible, so if you know an interesting move that we have missed – do tell one of us either over the forums or in game.~~

> Also you can contact us on [KAG Discord](https://discord.gg/kag) (`Eluded#1367`, `deynarde#4491`).
