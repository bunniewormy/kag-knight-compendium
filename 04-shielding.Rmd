# Shielding

## Shield slide stun

Shield sliding horizontally into the enemy will stun them for a short duration if you have enough speed.
This stun is long enough to get 1 quick jab.

This move is most useful in narrow corridors where it cannot be countered by overhead jab or overhead slash.

## Shield bash

Another way to stun someone is to land on them from above whilst shielding. Even a landing from a very small height can be enough to stun someone.

In order to be able to jab after the stun you should hold S as you land. If not then you will bounce off the enemy and will be too far away to be able to jab before their stun wears off.
